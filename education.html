<p><em>Sekolah Kebangsaan Langkawi</em> was my primary school. This school is located at Jalan Persiaran Putra, Kuah, 07000 Langkawi. I study at this school untill standard 6, and also take <i>Ujian Penilaian Sekolah Rendah</i> (UPSR) in the same school. My result for UPSR is good but not 5A's. This school is full with dedicated teachers and helpful friends which make me sometimes remember all sweet memories with them. The time move very fast and this school was changed with beautiful where new building were developed and old building being fix and paint with new colour after I move to my secondary school.</p>
