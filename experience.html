<p>I have no working experience untill now. Although, I have many free time or long semester break I still not working. This is due to I have no motorcycle license and friends for accompany me in searching work as well as working.</p>
<br>
<br>

<p>I also dream that one day I can work as part-time worker at McDonald's, the popular fast food restaurant around the world. The main reason I want to work at this popular fast food restaurant is I want to help people through serving fast food with high quality of standard. Apart from that, I want to develop my communication skills when confronting with the customers.</p>
<br>
<br>

<p>But, I do not expecting too much for working at McDonald's. If my fate working as part-time worker at other place in the future, I will accept it and try do my best.
