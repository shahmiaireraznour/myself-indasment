Whenever Chan Li Jin goes to work at the Mercy Malaysia office in Petaling Jaya these days, she sees less than half of her colleagues than usual.
Of course, before meeting any of them, the non-profit’s communications and strategic engagement head sanitises her hands and has her body temperature checked at the main entrance.
Inside the office, thanks to flexible working hours and re-assigning of staff to another location, they have been able to meet the required social distancing rule when it comes to seating arrangements.
The International Trade and Industry Ministry (Miti) has set out a standard operating procedure (SOP) for the reopening of businesses and offices in view of the ‘new normal’ situation due to Covid-19.
One of the key points is the social distancing practice of ensuring a minimum of 1m, with 2m encouraged as far as possible, between people.
The 2m distance is recommended by experts at the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It is also widely advocated by global real estate company Cushman and Wakefield, which developed a new concept inside its own Amsterdam headquarters called the Six Feet Office, showing how employees can stay that distance from each other at all times.
The concept was developed using knowledge gathered in China, World Health Organisation data and the advice of medical specialists. As reported in Forbes.com last month, the company has helped over 10,000 organisations in China get nearly one million people back to work while staying as safe as possible.</p>
