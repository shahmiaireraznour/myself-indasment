Whenever Chan Li Jin goes to work at the Mercy Malaysia office in Petaling Jaya these days, she sees less than half of her colleagues than usual.
Of course, before meeting any of them, the non-profit’s communications and strategic engagement head sanitises her hands and has her body temperature checked at the main entrance.
Inside the office, thanks to flexible working hours and re-assigning of staff to another location, they have been able to meet the required social distancing rule when it comes to seating arrangements.
The International Trade and Industry Ministry (Miti) has set out a standard operating procedure (SOP) for the reopening of businesses and offices in view of the ‘new normal’ situation due to Covid-19.
One of the key points is the social distancing practice of ensuring a minimum of 1m, with 2m encouraged as far as possible, between people.
The 2m distance is recommended by experts at the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It is also widely advocated by global real estate company Cushman and Wakefield, which developed a new concept inside its own Amsterdam headquarters called the Six Feet Office, showing how employees can stay that distance from each other at all times.
The concept was developed using knowledge gathered in China, World Health Organisation data and the advice of medical specialists. As reported in Forbes.com last month, the company has helped over 10,000 organisations in China get nearly one million people back to work while staying as safe as possible.</p>

<p>The Six Feet Office includes a range of design tools to keep co-workers 2m apart, including barriers between desks, pedestrian lanes that keep traffic flowing in an orderly way, and disposable supplies to keep germs from spreading.
On the local front, various offices have adhered to the Ministry’s SOP and adapted to a new way of working.
“A certain portion of our staff is now operating at our Covid-19 Operations Hub (in Kuala Lumpur), which reduces the number of people in the office, and we are also encouraging staff to work from home (WFH) if possible.” says Syed Reza Helmy Al-Attas, Mercy Malaysia’s head of human resource and administration services.
“We are maintaining the present seating arrangement in our office as we are able to keep to a 1m distancing between staff members,” he added.
Before the movement control order, the office recorded a total of 42 staff, all stationed on one floor. The majority of staff have their own individual cubicles.
“We have also issued a policy on meetings and gatherings, limiting the number of people to 10, though we encourage online meetings even if they are in the office,” said Syed Reza, adding that markings have been placed on seats, floors, sofas and the pantry following the social distancing rule.
Other measures include having only one entrance and exit to the office, introducing a new letters and parcel acceptance processes, and controlling how staff, visitors, volunteers, technicians and contractors enter the office.
In future, he said the organisation will set up better hand sanitisation stations and change taps to those that require less contact.
“We will continue to look at how we can improve based on actual experience and needs,” he said.
Meanwhile, staff at multi-disciplinary design firm Veritas Design Group started returning to their office from May 11.
Following guidelines provided by Miti, the group has detailed out an action plan and SOP that include an improvised office layout, disinfecting procedures, staff behaviour at the workplace, as well as best practices should an emergency arise.</p>
