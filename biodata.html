<p>My name is Ahmad Shahmi Aire Bin Mohd Razali. I am 24 years old. I am the youngest siblings of 2 brothers. I live at PT 237, Taman Haji Ali Pangkal Kalong Kok Lanas 16450, Ketereh Kelantan Darul Naim.</p>
<br>
<br>

<p>Besides, I study at Universiti Teknologi MARA Kelantan (Machang Campus) and my course is Bachelor in Office Systems Management (Hons). My faculty is Faculty of Business and Management. This course although seems like easy but unfortunately not. I start to realize that in life, there is no easy thing that comes to the someone unless effort, patience and tawakkal to Allah SWT was put in the journey toward success.</p>
<br>
<br>

<p>Moreover, my favourite food is "Nasi Kukus" while my favourite drink is iced tea. I am also a gadget enthusiast. I love to know what gadget is release in the market like Apple Iphone 11 and the latest one is Huawei Nova 7. Apart from that, I like to find and read new novel from Penerbitan Karyaseni. I found this novel publisher was 6 years ago and I trust it because all novels from Penerbitan Karyaseni is outstanding. I have read some novels from this publisher and all of them is good, neat and attractive. The novels that I have read from Penerbitan Karyaseni are <i>"Jika Mawar Pudar Warna", "The Wedding Breaker", "Hijrah Cinta, Kerana Dia", Dia Bukan Bidadari" and "Di Taman Larangan"</i>. For more information about Penerbitan Karyaseni, I will share the link this publisher but via Facebook.<a href="https://www.facebook.com/Karyaseni/">Visit the Penerbitan Karyaseni.</a></p>

<p>Furthermore, I am introvert person, but if someone ask me for help I will help them as I could, in shaa Allah. I have 5 close friends during my diploma but 3 of them was not continue study. So, only 1 of my friends continue her study at the campus with me but in different faculty. Friends is the most valueble gift from Allah SWT. If someone have close friends besides them, they should keep the friendship untill their old day.</p>

<br>

<p>Sometimes, I love to see a movie. The movie genre that I like to see are Adventure, Fantasy, Family, Action and Horror. The examples of movie that I have see such as <i>Jurassic World, Aladdin (2019), Avengers: Endgame, World War Z and Siam Square</i>. Although, I write all movies that I have see is from outside Malaysia, but I love to see a Malay movie too like <i>"Hantu Kak Limah Balik Rumah", "Bisik Pada Langit" and BoBoiBoy Movie 2</i>. This "impermanent hobby" can helps me in fills my leisure, get rid of my stress and can inspire me with the characters or storylines in the movie.</p>
